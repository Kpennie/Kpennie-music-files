How to add your own music to and API
Create a GitHub Repository (if you don’t have one yet)
Upload Files via GitHub Web Interface (Easy way)
Open your repository page on GitHub Click Add file → Upload files Drag and drop your MP3 files and the songs.json file (or select them) (do this one or two at a time because there's a file size limit) Scroll down, add a commit message like “Add mp3 tracks and songs.json” Click Commit changesAccess Your Files Publicly via GitHub Pages,
Go to your repository Settings tab Scroll down to Pages (or “GitHub Pages” section) Under Source, select the branch (main or master) and folder /root or /docs (usually /root if you uploaded files at root) Click Save GitHub will generate a URL like https://your-username.github.io/my-mp3-host/ If you see a .io link you did it right

Put this in your Home.jsx file: const SONG_BASE_URL = "https://your-username.github.io/my-mp3-host/"; useEffect(() => { const loadSongs = async () => { try { setIsLoading(true); const response = await fetch(SONG_BASE_URL + "songs.json"); if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Failed to load songs.json"); const data = await response.json(); setSongs(data); } catch (err) { console.error("Error loading songs:", err); setError("Failed to load songs. Please try again."); } finally { setIsLoading(false); } }; loadSongs(); }, []); const playSong = (index) => { if (songs.length === 0) return; const song = songs[index]; if (!song) return; const audioElement = audioRef.current; if (audioElement) { audioElement.src = SONG_BASE_URL + song.id; // or song.filename audioElement.play() .then(() => setIsPlaying(true)) .catch((error) => { console.error("Error playing song:", error); setError("Failed to play song. Please try again."); }); } setCurrentSongIndex(index); };  Replace the SONG_BASE_URL with your git.io url. As long as your the "id" in your json matches exactly how it is your github you won't have any issues. For example: in github it says "Started from the Bottom by Drake.mp3" Your "id" must say... { "id": "Started from the Bottom by Drake.mp3 "name": "Started from the Bottom", "author": "Drake" },  Hope this makes sense!
